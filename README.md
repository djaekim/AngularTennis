<h1> Tennis AutoComplete </h1>
<p> This is my first project using Angular.
The core of this application is the auto-complete search box. Namely, programs check if each character typed in the input tag exist within the player names. If it exists then we push it into the filtered array, which we will be displayed using *ngFor. The player names also have (click) event bound, which display a new user component</p>
